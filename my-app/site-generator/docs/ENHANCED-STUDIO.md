The Enhanced Studio provides a modern and flexible workflow for rapidly creating websites with custom components. This document explains the key features and workflow improvements.

## Key Features

### Modern Interface

- **Component Browser**: Browse, search, and filter components by type, tags, and other metadata
- **Advanced Theme Editor**: Fine-tune colors, typography, spacing, and visual effects

### Flexible Workflow

Unlike the traditional step-by-step approach, the enhanced studio allows you to:

1. Start with any aspect of your site (components, theme, content)
2. Add components in any order
3. Edit theme and content properties at any time
4. Preview changes instantly

## Interface Components

### Left Sidebar

The left sidebar provides a hierarchical view of your site structure:

- **Pages**: Organize content by page
- **Sections**: View and manage all sections on the current page
- **Add Section**: Quickly add new sections to your page

### Main Panel

The main panel is context-aware and shows different tools based on what you're working on:

- **Preview**: Shows a full preview of your site with device switching
- **Components**: Browse and add components from the component library
- **Theme**: Edit theme settings including colors, typography, spacing, and effects
- **Export**: Export your site in various formats

### Right Sidebar (Inspector)

The right sidebar appears when you select a component, showing:

- **Component Properties**: Edit content, settings, and styling
- **Variant Selector**: Switch between component variants
- **Advanced Settings**: Configure component-specific options

## Using Custom Components

The Enhanced Studio makes it easier to work with custom components:

### Adding Custom Components

1. Open the Components tab from the top navigation
2. Browse for components by type (section, block, element) or use search/filters
3. Click a component to see variants and details
4. Click Add to insert the component into your site

### Editing Components

1. Select a component in the preview or structure panel
2. Use the Inspector to modify its properties
3. Switch variants to quickly try different styles
4. Changes are reflected in real-time in the preview

### Creating Custom Component Collections

1. Create reusable components for your brand
2. Organize them into collections
3. Share components across multiple projects

## Quick Start

1. Open the Enhanced Studio by visiting `/studio/enhanced`
2. Add your first section using the component browser
3. Customize the theme in the Theme panel
4. Edit component content in the Inspector
5. Preview your site at different screen sizes
6. Export when ready

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`: Open command palette
- `Esc`: Close any open modal/panel
- `Tab` (in command palette): Toggle between actions and components
- Arrow keys: Navigate in command palette
- `Enter`: Select item in command palette

## Enhanced Workflow Tips

### For rapid prototyping:

1. Start with a theme preset
2. Add primary sections (hero, features, testimonials)
3. Use the quick palette for fast navigation
4. Adjust theme settings as needed

### For client projects:

1. Import client brand colors in the Theme Editor
2. Create custom components with client branding
3. Use the structure panel to organize content
4. Save component variants for different sections
5. Export to code for further customization

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Structure**: Begin by adding main sections to establish page flow
2. **Theme Early**: Set your theme basics before detailed content editing
3. **Use Components**: Leverage pre-built components rather than starting from scratch
4. **Preview Often**: Check different device sizes throughout the process
5. **Save Variants**: Create component variants for recurring design patterns

The Enhanced Studio interface is designed to be flexible and intuitive, allowing developers to quickly create professional websites while maintaining creative freedom.
