# Visual Studio Interface

The Visual Studio interface is our most intuitive and streamlined approach for quickly mocking up websites. Designed with speed and simplicity in mind, this interface is perfect for web development agencies that need to rapidly prototype client sites.

## Key Features

### Template-First Approach
- **Industry-Specific Templates**: Start with pre-designed templates tailored for specific business types
- **Categorized Gallery**: Find the perfect starting point organized by industry and purpose
- **Instant Preview**: See exactly what you're getting before you start customizing

### Unified Visual Editor
- **Visual Canvas**: See your site as you build it with a central visual editor
- **Context-Aware Panels**: Tools and options change based on what you're working on
- **In-Canvas Editing**: Edit text and content directly on the preview for maximum speed

### Component System
- **Drag and Drop**: Add new components with simple drag and drop
- **Visual Component Browser**: Browse components with visual previews
- **Recently Used**: Quick access to your most frequently used components

### Simplified Workflow
Unlike our other studio interfaces that separate steps like template selection, content editing, and theme customization into distinct phases, Visual Studio combines everything into a single, unified experience:

1. Select a template (or start from scratch)
2. Add, edit, and arrange components visually
3. Apply theme changes that reflect instantly
4. Export your finished site

## Interface Areas

### Template Gallery
The first screen you'll see is our template gallery, with templates organized by industry. Select a template that best matches your needs as a starting point.

### Visual Editor
The main workspace has three key areas:

- **Side Panel**: Contains component library, theme controls, and layer management
- **Canvas**: Central editing area showing your site with in-place editing
- **Properties Panel**: Context-aware panel that shows options for your selected component

### Theme System
The simplified theme system allows for:
- One-click theme presets
- Brand color customization
- Typography selection
- Live preview of all changes

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Cmd/Ctrl + K**: Open command palette
- **Escape**: Exit fullscreen preview or close any modals
- **Delete/Backspace**: Remove selected component (when focused)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with a template**: Even if you'll make major changes, starting with a template saves time
2. **Edit content in place**: Use the direct editing whenever possible for the fastest workflow
3. **Apply themes early**: Set your theme foundation early to maintain visual consistency
4. **Use layers panel**: The layers panel helps maintain a clear structure and order for your page
5. **Save frequently**: Use the export function to save versions as you go

## When to Use Visual Studio

The Visual Studio interface is ideal for:
- Quick client mockups and prototypes
- Simple marketing and landing pages
- Testing different design approaches rapidly
- Non-technical team members who need visual feedback

For more complex projects with custom code requirements, you may want to consider the Enhanced Studio which provides more advanced tooling.
